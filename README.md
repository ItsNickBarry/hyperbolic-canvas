# Hyperbolic Canvas
An HTML canvas implementation of the Poincar√© disk model of the hyperbolic plane.

## Functions
* Calculate hyperbolic distance of point from center
* Calculate hyperbolic distance between points
* Draw hyperbolic line between points
* Calculate Euclidean arclength between a point and a destination point given hyperbolic distance and hyperbolic line.

## Usage
Add a div with the class "hyperbolic-canvas" to an HTML page.  Load the Javascript found in "lib/hc.js" on that page.  To allow the canvas to automatically resize, give the div the additional class "hyperbolic-canvas-autoresize".  

## Issues
I don't know how geometry works.  I don't know how math works.  Does anyone, really?  If you do, and you notice an oversight, please open a new issue.
